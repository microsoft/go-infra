# In the yml tree, a condition on a sequence is actually a mapping with the
# sequence as its content. So, two indents are logical, for a self-consistent
# YAML style.
example1:
  - ${ inlineif true }:
      - step 1
      - step 2
  - ${ inlineelse }:
      - step 1 implemented differently

# However, Azure Pipelines YAML encourages indenting only once. This also works.
