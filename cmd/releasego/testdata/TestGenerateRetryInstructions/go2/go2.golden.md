Based on the variables that were set by this build when it failed, here's a suggestion on how to resolve the issue:



### âŒš Wait for internal mirror

Once the sync-from-upstream PR merges, mirroring the merge commit from GitHub to the AzDO internal mirror should only take a few minutes. If it times out, there is likely an outage in some deeper part of the infrastructure.

Look for a mirroring outage already reported in the [First Responder Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aafba3d1545dd45d7b79f34c1821f6055%40thread.skype/First%2520Responders?groupId=4d73664c-9f2f-450d-82a5-c2f02756606d&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47). If you don't see one reported within the last few hours, post about the mirroring issue there to alert the infra team and get help. Once the issue is resolved, **Retry** to resume polling.

If the build failed for a non-polling or other unusual reason, the info above may be irrelevant to the problem that occurred. Examine the build logs for more information.
