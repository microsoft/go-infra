Completed releasing one version! If every version's release-build and innerloop tests are successful, approve the release-go-images build to continue.

This appears to be a new major version! If so, here are the major version related updates to do when the release is done:
* [ ] Update the [microsoft/go download links](https://github.com/microsoft/go/blob/microsoft/main/eng/doc/Downloads.md)
* [ ] Update the [internal site's download links](https://eng.ms/docs/more/languages-at-microsoft/go/articles/overview#go-releases)
* [ ] Update the [recommended Docker tags](https://github.com/microsoft/go-images#recommended-tags) and clean up unsupported Dockerfiles
* [ ] Clean up [the FIPS README](https://github.com/microsoft/go/blob/microsoft/main/eng/doc/fips/README.md) to focus on currently supported releases
