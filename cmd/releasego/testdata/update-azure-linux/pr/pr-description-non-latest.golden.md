golang: bump Go version to 1.23.3-2

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm the Microsoft Go team's bot. This is an automated pull request I generated to bump the Go version to [1.23.3-2](https://github.com/microsoft/go/releases/tag/v1.23.3-2).

I'm not able to run the Azure Linux pipelines yet, so the Microsoft Go release runner will need to finalize this PR. @a-go-developer
