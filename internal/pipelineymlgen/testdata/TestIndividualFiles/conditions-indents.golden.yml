# In the yml tree, a condition on a sequence is actually a mapping with the
# sequence as its content. So, two indents are logical, for a self-consistent
# YAML style.
example1:
  - step 1
  - step 2
# However, Azure Pipelines YAML encourages indenting only once. This also works.
example2:
  - step 1
  - step 2
