	// Upstream is the upstream Git repository to take updates from.
	Upstream string
	// UpstreamMirror is an optional upstream-maintained mirror of the Upstream repository.
	// Specifically, for Upstream 'https://go.googlesource.com/go', the UpstreamMirror is
	// 'https://github.com/golang/go'.
	//
	// When updating a submodule, sync checks both repos and only updates to a version that is in
	// both. This ensures our dev process doesn't have a strong dependency on one copy of upstream's
	// code or the other, and makes it reasonable to point the submodule at the GitHub mirror of Go
	// by default, which has a better appearance in the GitHub UI for a submodule: a clickable link.
	//
	// When merging a fork, the check is skipped. A fork inherently mirrors the upstream code, so
	// there is no reason to look for a common version and hold back.
	//
	// If UpstreamMirror is not defined (default), the update simply uses the latest version of
	// Upstream.
	UpstreamMirror string

	// Target is the GitHub repository to merge into, then submit the PR onto. It must be an https
	// github.com URL. Other arguments passed to the sync tool may transform this URL into a
	// different URL that works with authentication.
	Target string
	// Head is the GitHub repository to store the merged branch on. If not specified, defaults to
	// the value of Target. This can be used to run the PR from a GitHub fork.
	Head string
	// MirrorTarget	is an optional Git repository to push the upstream branch to. All mirroring
	// operations must succeed before sync continues with this sync config entry. The mirror target
	// is intended to be an internal repo, for reliability and security purposes. Mirrored branches
	// use the same name as they have in Upstream, ignoring BranchMap.
	MirrorTarget string

	// BranchMap is a map of source branch names in Upstream (keys) to use to update a corresponding
	// branch in Target (values), where Target is either a fork repo of Upstream or contains a
	// submodule of Upstream. The key is glob matched. If the value contains "?" (not a valid branch
	// character), "?" is replaced with the upstream branch name.

	// AutoSyncBranches is the list of branches that a call to "./cmd/sync" should bring up to date.

	// AutoMirrorBranches is a list of branches that should be mirrored to MirrorTarget, in addition
	// to the list of branches in AutoSyncBranches. A "*" is glob matched. "./cmd/releasego sync"

	// hash to treat as the latest commit for that source branch, no matter what the upstream
	// repository says at the time of merge. This map can be used to avoid a race between the sync
	// infrastructure and upstream merge flow.

	// some cases this isn't possible. In these cases, Target has in-place modifications that must
	// be auto-resolved during the sync process.
	AutoResolveTarget []string
	// SubmoduleTarget is the path of a submodule in the Target repo to update with the latest
	// version of Upstream and UpstreamMirror (if specified). If this option is not specified
	// (default), that indicates the entire Upstream repository should be merged into the Target
	// repository.
	SubmoduleTarget string

	// GoVersionFileContent	is empty, or the Go version that the microsoft/go build should use
	// after the sync. Should be in the upstream format, e.g. go1.17.10 and go1.18. Sync examines
	// VERSION in the submodule, and if it doesn't match the expected value, creates/updates VERSION
	// in the outer repo (microsoft/go) to specify it. Otherwise, cleans up the outer VERSION file.
	GoVersionFileContent string

	// GoMicrosoftRevisionFileContent is empty, or the Microsoft revision (1, 2, ...) that the
