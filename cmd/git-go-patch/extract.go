This command figures out which commits are new by checking for commits in HEAD since the given
commit. If no commit is given, the commit recorded by "apply" is used. If the given commit is not an
ancestor of the HEAD commit, "extract" formats patches for each commit until a common ancestor of HEAD
and the given commit. (See "git format-patch" documentation for "<since>".)

extract uses "git format-patch" internally, passing additional arguments to reduce the amount of
non-repeatable data in the resulting patch file.
